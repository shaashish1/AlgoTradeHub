# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive multi-exchange trading system that allows users to select their preferred trading exchange while maintaining flexibility in market data sources. The system will support both cryptocurrency and stock trading across multiple exchanges with secure API credential management and automated currency handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to select my preferred trading exchange from a dropdown list, so that I can trade on my exchange of choice while maintaining a consistent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown list of supported exchanges
2. WHEN the user selects an exchange THEN the system SHALL update the trading interface to reflect the selected exchange
3. WHEN the user selects "Set as Default" THEN the system SHALL save this preference and auto-select it on future app launches
4. IF the exchange supports cryptocurrency THEN the system SHALL configure for USDT/INR trading pairs
5. IF the exchange supports stocks THEN the system SHALL configure for INR trading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to securely enter my API credentials for live trading, so that I can execute real trades on my selected exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live trading is enabled THEN the system SHALL prompt for API key and secret input
2. WHEN API credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL validate them with the selected exchange
3. WHEN credentials are validated THEN the system SHALL store them securely in encrypted format
4. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL retrieve stored credentials without re-prompting
5. IF credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent live trading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically fetch market data from the most reliable source, so that I have accurate pricing information regardless of my trading exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL identify the best market data source for each symbol
2. WHEN market data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch from the optimal data source (not necessarily the trading exchange)
3. WHEN market data is unavailable from primary source THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative exchanges
4. WHEN displaying market data THEN the system SHALL show latest price, order book, and price history
5. WHEN currency differences exist THEN the system SHALL handle conversion automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to execute buy/sell orders only on my selected exchange, so that my trades are processed through my preferred platform with my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trade order is placed THEN the system SHALL execute it only on the user-selected exchange
2. WHEN executing trades THEN the system SHALL use only the user's stored API credentials
3. WHEN handling currency differences THEN the system SHALL automatically convert between USDT/INR as needed
4. WHEN trade execution fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information
5. WHEN trade is successful THEN the system SHALL update the trading dashboard with execution details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a comprehensive trading dashboard, so that I can monitor market data and manage my trades from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current market data for selected symbols
2. WHEN market data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the display in real-time
3. WHEN viewing the order book THEN the system SHALL show current bid/ask levels
4. WHEN executing trades THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on order status
5. WHEN trades are completed THEN the system SHALL update the portfolio and trade history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the exchange system to be modular, so that new exchanges can be added easily in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new exchange THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes
2. WHEN implementing exchange adapters THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
3. WHEN configuring new exchanges THEN the system SHALL support both crypto and stock trading types
4. WHEN testing new exchanges THEN the system SHALL provide sandbox/testnet capabilities
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing exchanges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to run locally for development and testing, so that I can develop and test features without cloud dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL operate entirely on localhost
2. WHEN testing features THEN the system SHALL support sandbox/demo modes for all exchanges
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use local file storage or embedded database
4. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt them locally without external services
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging for all exchange interactions
